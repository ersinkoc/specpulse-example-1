# Specification: OAuth2 Provider Integration

## Metadata
- **ID**: SPEC-002
- **Created**: 2025-10-05
- **Author**: User
- **AI Assistant**: Claude Code
- **Version**: 1.0.0

## Executive Summary
A comprehensive user authentication system that integrates with OAuth2 providers (Google, GitHub, etc.) while maintaining local authentication capabilities. This system will provide secure user registration, login, profile management, and session management with JWT tokens for API security.

## Problem Statement
Modern applications need flexible authentication options that cater to different user preferences. Users expect the convenience of social login (OAuth2) while maintaining the option for traditional email/password authentication. The system needs to handle multiple authentication providers securely while maintaining a consistent user experience and robust security.

## Proposed Solution
Implement an OAuth2 provider integration system that combines:
- Social login integration with major providers (Google, GitHub, Facebook, etc.)
- Traditional email/password authentication
- JWT token-based session management
- User profile synchronization across providers
- Secure token handling and refresh mechanisms
- Role-based access control foundation

## Detailed Requirements

- Acceptance: New accounts require email verification before full access
- Priority: SHOULD

FR-009: User Roles and Permissions
- Acceptance: System supports basic role-based access control (user, admin)
- Priority: COULD

FR-010: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Acceptance: Optional 2FA support for enhanced security
- Priority: COULD

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance

#### Security
- Authentication: OAuth2.0 + JWT
- Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Data Protection: Encrypted passwords, secure token storage
- Compliance: GDPR, CCPA data handling requirements

#### Scalability
- User Load: 10,000+ concurrent users
- Data Volume: 100,000+ user accounts
- Geographic Distribution: Multi-region deployment capability

## User Stories

### Story 1: Social Login Registration
**As a** new user
**I want** to register using my Google account
**So that** I can quickly access the application without creating a new password

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can click "Login with Google" button
- [ ] OAuth2 flow redirects to Google authentication
- [ ] User is redirected back with profile information
- [ ] Account is created automatically with Google profile data
- [ ] JWT token is issued for immediate login
- [ ] User email is verified through Google

### Story 2: Traditional Registration
**As a** privacy-conscious user
**I want** to register with email and password
**So that** I don't have to share my social media accounts

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Registration form collects email, password, and name
- [ ] Password validation meets security requirements
- [ ] Email verification is sent to confirm account
- [ ] Account is activated after email verification
- [ ] Password is properly hashed and stored securely
- [ ] User can login immediately after verification

### Story 3: Account Linking
**As a** returning user
**I want** to link my GitHub account to my existing email account
**So that** I can login using either method

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Existing user can link additional OAuth2 providers
- [ ] System detects and prevents duplicate account creation
- [ ] User can choose which profile information to use
- [ ] Login works with any linked provider
- [ ] User can unlink providers if desired

### Story 4: Token Management
**As a** authenticated user
**I want** to remain logged in across sessions
**So that** I don't have to login repeatedly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] JWT access token expires after configurable time (1 hour default)
- [ ] Refresh token allows seamless session renewal
- [ ] Tokens are stored securely (httpOnly cookies or secure storage)
- [ ] User can logout to invalidate tokens immediately
- [ ] System handles token expiration gracefully

### Story 5: Profile Management
**As a** registered user
**I want** to view and update my profile information
**So that** I can keep my account information current

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can view profile information from all linked providers
- [ ] User can update basic profile fields (name, avatar)
- [ ] Profile changes are synchronized where applicable
- [ ] User can change password if using local authentication
- [ ] User can delete account with confirmation

## Technical Constraints

- OAuth2 provider integration requires valid API keys and secrets
- JWT secret must be securely managed
- Database schema must support account linking
- Email service required for verification and password reset
- HTTPS required for all authentication endpoints
- State parameter must be used for OAuth2 CSRF protection

## Dependencies

- OAuth2 provider APIs (Google, GitHub, Facebook, etc.)
- Email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, or similar)
- Database for user accounts and session storage
- JWT library for token management
- Password hashing library (bcrypt)
- Validation library for input sanitization

## Risks and Mitigations

**Risk**: OAuth2 provider API changes
- **Mitigation**: Use established OAuth2 libraries with provider abstraction

**Risk**: Token security breaches
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper token rotation, short expiration times, secure storage

**Risk**: Account takeovers through social login
- **Mitigation**: Implement email verification, account linking validation

**Risk**: Scalability issues with authentication database
- **Mitigation**: Use efficient indexing, consider read replicas, caching

**Risk**: Privacy compliance violations
- **Mitigation**: Implement data retention policies, user consent management

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] All user stories completed
- [ ] Performance targets met (<500ms response time)
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied (OAuth2 compliance, token security)
- [ ] Support for multiple authentication providers
- [ ] Seamless user experience across authentication methods

## Open Questions
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which OAuth2 providers should be prioritized for initial implementation?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should we implement account email verification for OAuth2 registrations?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the specific password complexity requirements?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should JWT refresh tokens be stored in database or client-side?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What user roles should be available in the initial implementation?]
