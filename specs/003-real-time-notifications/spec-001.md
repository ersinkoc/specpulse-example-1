# Specification: Real-Time Notifications System

## Metadata
- **ID**: SPEC-003-001
- **Created**: 2025-10-05
- **Author**: SpecPulse AI

- **Version**: 1.0.0

## Executive Summary
A WebSocket-based real-time notifications system that delivers instant messages to users through websockets, integrates with the existing user authentication system, and supports user preference management for notification types and delivery methods.

## Problem Statement
Users need to receive timely notifications about important events in the application, such as system updates, security alerts, task assignments, and social interactions. The current system lacks real-time communication capabilities, requiring users to manually refresh or poll for updates.

## Proposed Solution
Implement a WebSocket-based real-time notification system integrated with the existing Express.js application, utilizing Redis for message queuing and scaling, and building on the established user authentication infrastructure for secure, personalized notification delivery.

## Detailed Requirements

### Functional Requirements

FR-001: Real-time message delivery via WebSocket connections
  - Acceptance: Users receive notifications within 100ms of system events
  - Priority: MUST

FR-002: User authentication for WebSocket connections
  - Acceptance: Only authenticated users can establish WebSocket connections
  - Priority: MUST

FR-003: User notification preferences management
  - Acceptance: Users can enable/disable specific notification types
  - Priority: MUST

FR-004: Notification history and persistence
  - Acceptance: Users can view their notification history for the last 30 days
  - Priority: SHOULD

FR-005: Multi-channel notification support (WebSocket, email)
  - Acceptance: System can route notifications through multiple channels
  - Priority: COULD

FR-006: Notification read status tracking
  - Acceptance: System tracks which notifications have been read by users
  - Priority: SHOULD

FR-007: Bulk notification delivery for system-wide announcements
  - Acceptance: Administrators can send notifications to all users simultaneously
  - Priority: SHOULD

FR-008: Notification categories and priority levels
  - Acceptance: Notifications are categorized (security, system, social, task) with priority levels
  - Priority: MUST

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Response Time: <100ms for message delivery
- Throughput: 10,000 concurrent WebSocket connections
- Resource Usage: <512MB memory per 1,000 connections

#### Security
- Authentication: JWT token validation for WebSocket connections
- Authorization: Role-based access for system notifications
- Data Protection: Encrypted WebSocket communications (WSS)

#### Scalability
- User Load: Support 10,000 concurrent users
- Data Volume: 1M notifications per day
- Geographic Distribution: Support for multiple data centers

## User Stories

### Story 1: Real-time System Alerts
**As a** user
**I want** to receive instant notifications about system events
**So that** I can stay informed about important changes without manual refresh

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User receives security alerts within 100ms of generation
- [ ] User receives system maintenance notifications
- [ ] Notifications are delivered via WebSocket connection
- [ ] User can see notification count indicator

### Story 2: Notification Preferences
**As a** user
**I want** to control which types of notifications I receive
**So that** I can avoid notification fatigue and focus on relevant information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can enable/disable notification categories
- [ ] User can set quiet hours for notifications
- [ ] User preferences are persisted across sessions
- [ ] User can receive email notifications for critical alerts when offline

### Story 3: Notification History
**As a** user
**I want** to view my notification history
**So that** I can catch up on missed notifications and reference past information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can view notifications from last 30 days
- [ ] Notifications are marked as read/unread
- [ ] User can search through notification history
- [ ] System paginates large notification histories

### Story 4: Administrative Notifications
**As an** administrator
**I want** to send system-wide notifications
**So that** I can communicate important information to all users

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Administrator can compose and send bulk notifications
- [ ] System tracks delivery status of bulk notifications
- [ ] Only users with admin privileges can send bulk notifications
- [ ] System prevents notification spam (rate limiting for bulk sends)

## Technical Constraints

- Must integrate with existing Express.js application
- Must leverage existing PostgreSQL database and Redis infrastructure
- Must maintain compatibility with existing user authentication system
- WebSocket server must run alongside HTTP server
- Must support horizontal scaling with multiple server instances

## Dependencies

- Express.js application (existing)
- User authentication system (existing)
- PostgreSQL database (existing)
- Redis for message queuing (existing)
- Socket.IO or native WebSocket library
- JWT token validation (existing)

## Risks and Mitigations

**Risk**: WebSocket connection scaling issues
- **Mitigation**: Implement connection pooling and load balancing strategies

**Risk**: Memory usage with high concurrent connections
- **Mitigation**: Optimize message payload size and implement connection limits

**Risk**: Message delivery reliability
- **Mitigation**: Implement message persistence and retry mechanisms

**Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in WebSocket connections
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper authentication and message validation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] All user stories completed
- [ ] Performance targets met (<100ms delivery)
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied
- [ ] System supports 10,000 concurrent users
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities in WebSocket implementation
- [ ] 99.9% message delivery reliability

## Open Questions
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should we support push notifications for mobile devices?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the maximum acceptable notification payload size?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should notifications be searchable across all users for administrative purposes?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Do we need to support notification templates and dynamic content?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the retention policy for notification history?]

## Appendix

### Notification Categories
1. **Security** - Login alerts, password changes, suspicious activity
2. **System** - Maintenance, downtime, feature updates
3. **Social** - User interactions, mentions, follows
4. **Task** - Assignments, deadlines, completions
5. **Administrative** - System announcements, policy changes

### WebSocket Events
- `connect` - Client establishes connection
- `disconnect` - Client disconnects
- `notification:receive` - Client receives notification
- `notification:read` - Client marks notification as read
- `preferences:update` - Client updates notification preferences
- `admin:broadcast` - Administrator sends system-wide notification
