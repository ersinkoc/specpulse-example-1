# Specification: RESTful API with Express.js

## Metadata
- **ID**: SPEC-001
- **Created**: 2025-10-05

- **Version**: 1.0.0

## Executive Summary
A RESTful API built with Express.js framework that provides basic CRUD operations with proper routing, middleware, and error handling. This API will serve as a foundation for web applications requiring backend data management capabilities.

## Problem Statement
Developers need a simple, well-structured backend API that handles HTTP requests for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data resources. The API should follow REST principles, handle errors gracefully, and be easily extensible for future features.

## Proposed Solution
Create an Express.js-based RESTful API server with modular routing structure, comprehensive middleware for logging and error handling, and JSON response formatting. The solution will include standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with appropriate status codes and response structures.

## Detailed Requirements

### Functional Requirements

FR-001: Express Server Setup
- Acceptance: Server successfully starts on configurable port and responds to basic health check
- Priority: MUST

FR-002: RESTful Routing
- Acceptance: API routes follow REST conventions with proper HTTP methods and URL patterns
- Priority: MUST

FR-003: JSON Request/Response Handling
- Acceptance: API accepts and returns properly formatted JSON with appropriate content-type headers
- Priority: MUST

FR-004: Error Handling Middleware
- Acceptance: All errors are caught and formatted as consistent JSON error responses
- Priority: MUST

FR-005: Logging Middleware
- Acceptance: HTTP requests are logged with method, URL, status code, and response time
- Priority: SHOULD

FR-006: Input Validation
- Acceptance: Request bodies are validated for required fields and data types
- Priority: SHOULD

FR-007: CORS Support
- Acceptance: API handles cross-origin requests with configurable CORS settings
- Priority: COULD

FR-008: API Documentation
- Acceptance: Endpoints are documented with expected request/response formats
- Priority: COULD

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Response Time: <200ms for simple operations
- Throughput: 100+ requests per second
- Resource Usage: <512MB memory footprint

#### Security
- Authentication: None required (public API)
- Authorization: Not applicable
- Data Protection: Input sanitization and validation

#### Scalability
- User Load: 100+ concurrent users
- Data Volume: In-memory storage sufficient for demonstration
- Geographic Distribution: Single region deployment

## User Stories

### Story 1: API Health Monitoring
**As a** developer
**I want** to check API health status
**So that** I can verify the service is running correctly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] GET /health returns 200 OK status
- [ ] Response includes service status and timestamp
- [ ] Endpoint responds within 50ms

### Story 2: Task Management
**As a** client application
**I want** to perform CRUD operations on tasks
**So that** I can manage task data through the API

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] POST /tasks creates new tasks with generated UUID
- [ ] GET /tasks returns list of all tasks with pagination support
- [ ] GET /tasks/:id returns specific task by UUID
- [ ] PUT /tasks/:id updates existing task fields
- [ ] DELETE /tasks/:id removes task from the system
- [ ] Task status can be updated to pending, in-progress, or completed

### Story 3: Error Handling
**As a** API consumer
**I want** to receive clear error messages
**So that** I can debug issues quickly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] 404 errors for missing resources
- [ ] 400 errors for invalid input
- [ ] 500 errors for server issues
- [ ] All errors include descriptive message and error code

## Technical Constraints
- Node.js runtime environment required
- Express.js framework as primary dependency
- In-memory data storage (no database required for basic implementation)
- JSON as primary data exchange format

## Dependencies
- Express.js 4.18.2 (stable version)
- Node.js 16.x or later
- Morgan: HTTP request logger middleware
- CORS: Cross-origin resource sharing middleware
- Helmet: Security middleware (optional)

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Memory leak with in-memory storage
  - **Mitigation**: Implement data cleanup and monitoring
- **Risk**: Poor error handling exposes sensitive information
  - **Mitigation**: Sanitize error messages and log securely
- **Risk**: API performance under load
  - **Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting and monitoring

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] All user stories completed
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied
- [ ] API follows REST conventions consistently

## Open Questions
- **RESOLVED**: Data model will manage "tasks" with properties: id, title, description, status, createdAt, updatedAt
- **RESOLVED**: Authentication is out of scope for initial version, can be added in future iterations
- **RESOLVED**: Use Morgan middleware with combined format, output to console for development
- **RESOLVED**: Standard Node.js deployment, no specific constraints, can run on any platform supporting Node.js

## Appendix
### API Endpoint Design
```
GET    /health              - Health check
GET    /tasks               - List all tasks
POST   /tasks               - Create new task
GET    /tasks/:id           - Get specific task
PUT    /tasks/:id           - Update task
DELETE /tasks/:id           - Delete task
```

### Data Model (Task Resource)
```json
{
  "id": "string (UUID)",
  "title": "string (required, max 100 chars)",
  "description": "string (optional, max 500 chars)",
  "status": "enum (pending|in-progress|completed)",
  "createdAt": "ISO timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "ISO timestamp"
}
```

### Response Format Examples
```json
// Success Response
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "message": "Operation completed successfully"
}

// Error Response
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "The requested resource was not found"
  }
}
```
