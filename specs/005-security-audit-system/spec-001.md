# Specification: Security Audit System

## Metadata
- **ID**: SPEC-005
- **Created**: 2025-10-05T23:15:00+03:00
- **Author**: Security Team
- **AI Assistant**: Claude
- **Version**: 1.0.0

## Executive Summary
The Security Audit System provides comprehensive vulnerability scanning, security monitoring, and compliance management for the application platform. It enables automated security assessments, real-time threat detection, and detailed audit reporting to ensure the platform maintains high security standards and regulatory compliance.

## Problem Statement
As the application platform grows with user authentication, profile management, and real-time notifications, there is an increasing need for systematic security monitoring and vulnerability assessment. Currently, security monitoring is ad-hoc and reactive, making it difficult to identify potential threats, track security incidents, and maintain compliance with security standards like GDPR and SOC 2.

## Proposed Solution
Implement a comprehensive Security Audit System that provides automated vulnerability scanning, real-time security monitoring, audit trail management, and compliance reporting. The system will integrate with existing authentication and notification services to provide centralized security oversight and incident response capabilities.

FR-006: Security Configuration Management
- Acceptance: System manages and enforces security policies across the application infrastructure
- Priority: SHOULD

## User Stories

### Story 1: Security Administrator Dashboard
**As a** Security Administrator
**I want** A comprehensive security dashboard
**So that** I can monitor the overall security posture and identify potential threats quickly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Dashboard displays real-time security metrics
- [ ] Shows vulnerability scan results and severity levels
- [ ] Provides security incident timeline and details
- [ ] Allows filtering and sorting of security events

### Story 2: Automated Vulnerability Scanning
**As a** Security Administrator
**I want** Automated vulnerability scanning
**So that** I can identify and address security weaknesses before they are exploited

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] System performs scheduled vulnerability scans
- [ ] Scans include dependencies, code, and infrastructure
- [ ] Results are categorized by severity
- [ ] Automatic notifications for critical vulnerabilities

### Story 3: Compliance Reporting
**As a** Compliance Officer
**I want** Automated compliance reports
**So that** I can demonstrate adherence to security standards and regulations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Reports cover GDPR, SOC 2, and custom compliance frameworks
- [ ] Reports are customizable and exportable
- [ ] Historical compliance tracking
- [ ] Evidence collection for audits

### Story 4: Real-time Security Monitoring
**As a** Security Administrator
**I want** Real-time security alerts
**So that** I can respond to security incidents immediately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Immediate alerts for critical security events
- [ ] Configurable alert rules and thresholds
- [ ] Integration with existing notification system
- [ ] Escalation procedures for severe incidents

## Technical Constraints

- Must integrate with existing PostgreSQL database without performance impact
- Must support high-volume log processing (1000+ events/second)
- Must maintain data integrity and tamper-proof audit trails
- Must comply with data protection regulations (GDPR)
- Must not interfere with application performance

## Dependencies

- External Services: OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk API, Nessus Scanner API
- Libraries: Winston (logging), Node-cron (scheduling), Helmet (security headers)
- Internal Services: User Authentication (002), Real-time Notifications (003)
- Database: PostgreSQL with time-series extensions for log storage
- Infrastructure: Redis for caching and message queuing

## Risks and Mitigations

**Risk 1**: Performance impact on main application
- **Mitigation**: Asynchronous processing, dedicated monitoring infrastructure

**Risk 2**: False positive security alerts
- **Mitigation**: Machine learning for alert correlation, configurable thresholds

**Risk 3**: Data privacy concerns with audit logs
- **Mitigation**: Data encryption, minimal data collection, GDPR compliance

**Risk 4**: Integration complexity with existing systems
- **Mitigation**: Phased implementation, comprehensive testing, fallback mechanisms

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] All user stories completed
- [ ] Performance targets met (sub-100ms alert processing)
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied (no vulnerabilities in security system itself)
- [ ] Compliance with GDPR and industry security standards

## Open Questions
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific compliance frameworks required beyond GDPR]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Retention period for audit logs]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Integration preferences for external security tools]

## Appendix

### Security Metrics to Track
- Authentication success/failure rates
- API request patterns and anomalies
- Vulnerability scan results over time
- Incident response times
- Compliance score percentages

### Alert Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Immediate threat requiring instant response
- **High**: Potential threat requiring investigation within 1 hour
- **Medium**: Suspicious activity requiring investigation within 24 hours
- **Low**: Informational events for monitoring purposes
