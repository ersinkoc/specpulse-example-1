# Specification: User Profile Management System

## Metadata
- **ID**: SPEC-004-001
- **Created**: 2025-10-05T21:10:00+03:00
- **Author**: Development Team
- **AI Assistant**: Claude Code
- **Version**: 1.0.0

## Executive Summary
A comprehensive user profile management system that allows authenticated users to create and customize their profiles with avatar support, bio editing, social links, privacy settings, and various profile customization options. This feature extends the existing JWT-based authentication system to provide users with rich profile management capabilities.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the authentication system provides basic user registration and login functionality but lacks comprehensive profile management features. Users need the ability to personalize their profiles, manage their public information, control privacy settings, and connect social media accounts to enhance their user experience and engagement.

## Proposed Solution
Implement a robust user profile management system that integrates seamlessly with the existing authentication infrastructure. The solution will include profile creation/editing capabilities, avatar upload and management, bio text editing, social media links, granular privacy controls, and profile customization options while maintaining security and performance standards.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Profile Creation and Basic Management
**As a** registered user
**I want** to create and edit my profile with basic information
**So that** I can present myself to other users on the platform

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Given I am logged in, I can access my profile creation page
- [ ] When I fill in my profile information and save, the data persists
- [ ] When I edit my profile later, I can update any field
- [ ] Then my profile is updated and displayed correctly

### Story 2: Avatar Management
**As a** user
**I want** to upload and manage my profile picture
**So that** other users can recognize me visually

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Given I have a profile, I can upload an avatar image
- [ ] When I upload an image, it is automatically resized and optimized
- [ ] When I want to change my avatar, I can upload a new one
- [ ] Then my new avatar is displayed across the platform

### Story 3: Privacy Control
**As a** user
**I want** to control who can see my profile information
**So that** I can protect my privacy and personal data

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Given I have a profile, I can access privacy settings
- [ ] When I set my profile to private, non-followers cannot see it
- [ ] When I configure specific section privacy, those settings are respected
- [ ] Then my privacy preferences are enforced across all profile views

### Story 4: Social Media Integration
**As a** user
**I want** to add my social media links to my profile
**So that** others can connect with me on other platforms

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Given I have a profile, I can add social media links
- [ ] When I add a URL, it is validated for correctness
- [ ] When someone views my profile, they can click on my social links
- [ ] Then my social media profiles are accessible and correctly displayed

## Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing JWT authentication system
- Avatar storage must use efficient file management
- Database schema must support profile extensibility
- API endpoints must follow RESTful conventions
- Must be responsive and mobile-friendly

## Dependencies
- Feature 002: User Authentication System (JWT tokens, user management)
- PostgreSQL database for profile data persistence
- File storage service for avatar management
- Email service for profile notifications

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Large avatar files may slow down performance
  - **Mitigation**: Implement automatic image compression and 4MB size limit
- **Risk**: Privacy settings complexity may confuse users
  - **Mitigation**: Provide clear UI and default privacy settings
- **Risk**: Social media links may become outdated
  - **Mitigation**: Implement periodic link validation
- **Risk**: Data loss when users delete profiles
  - **Mitigation**: Implement soft delete - no data is permanently removed from system

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] All user stories completed
- [ ] Performance targets met (500ms load time)
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied
- [ ] 95%+ user satisfaction with profile features
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities in profile management
