## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Pattern
- **Pattern**: Layered Architecture with Service-Oriented Design
- **Rationale**: Provides clear separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability while integrating seamlessly with existing authentication system

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript (existing stack)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js (existing stack)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (existing)
- **File Storage**: Cloud storage with CDN integration
- **Image Processing**: Sharp.js for server-side image optimization
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens (existing system)

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Soft Delete Policy**: Profile data is never permanently deleted - implements soft delete with archival
2. **File Storage Strategy**: Cloud storage with CDN for optimal avatar delivery performance
3. **Privacy-First Design**: All profile features are built with privacy controls as primary consideration
4. **Performance Optimization**: Image compression and caching for fast profile loading
5. **Incremental Enhancement**: Features are rolled out in phases to ensure stability

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Risk**: Large avatar files may impact performance
   - **Probability**: Medium
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: 4MB upload limit with automatic compression and CDN delivery

2. **Risk**: Privacy settings complexity may confuse users
   - **Probability**: High
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Clear UI design with default privacy settings and contextual help

3. **Risk**: Social media links may become outdated
   - **Probability**: Medium
   - **Impact**: Low
   - **Mitigation**: Periodic link validation and user notifications

4. **Risk**: Database performance with large profile data
   - **Probability**: Medium
   - **Impact**: High
   - **Mitigation**: Proper indexing, query optimization, and caching strategies

## Resource Requirements
- **Team Size**: 2-3 developers (1 backend, 1 frontend, 1 full-stack)
- **Timeline**: 6-8 weeks
- **Budget**: Moderate (mainly cloud storage costs)
- **Tools**: Existing development stack, cloud storage service, image processing library

## Dependencies
- Feature 002: User Authentication System (JWT tokens, user management)
- PostgreSQL database for profile data persistence
- Cloud storage service (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or similar)
- CDN service for avatar delivery
- Email service for profile notifications

## Monitoring & Success Metrics
- **Performance Metrics**: Profile page load time <500ms, avatar upload processing time <3s
- **Business Metrics**: Profile completion rate >80%, user engagement with profile features
- **Quality Metrics**: Zero critical bugs in production, <1% error rate on profile APIs
- **Security Metrics**: Zero data breaches, all privacy controls enforced

## SDD Compliance Status
- **Specification First**: ✅ Complete spec with all clarifications resolved
- **Incremental Planning**: ✅ 5 phases with clear objectives and success criteria
- **Task Decomposition**: ✅ Detailed tasks broken down by phase
- **Quality Assurance**: ✅ Comprehensive testing strategy defined
- **Architecture Documentation**: ✅ Technical decisions and rationale documented

## Notes
- This plan builds upon the existing authentication system (Feature 002)
- All profile features will require JWT authentication
- Privacy controls are implemented as a core requirement, not an afterthought
- Performance optimization is prioritized throughout implementation
- The soft delete policy ensures no data is ever permanently lost
