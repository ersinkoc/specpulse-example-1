## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Pattern
- **Pattern**: Event-driven microservices with WebSocket gateway
- **Rationale**: Separates concerns, enables horizontal scaling, and isolates WebSocket management

### Technology Stack
- **WebSocket Library**: Socket.IO (enhanced reliability and fallback support)
- **Message Queue**: Redis (existing infrastructure, pub/sub capabilities)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (existing, ACID compliance)
- **Authentication**: JWT (existing system integration)
- **Monitoring**: Custom metrics + existing logging infrastructure

### Key Design Decisions
1. **WebSocket Gateway Pattern**: Separate WebSocket server from HTTP server for isolation and scaling
   - **Rationale**: Prevents WebSocket issues from affecting HTTP API and enables independent scaling

2. **Redis Message Queuing**: Use Redis pub/sub for message distribution across multiple WebSocket server instances
   - **Rationale**: Leverages existing Redis infrastructure and provides reliable message delivery

3. **Database Persistence**: Store notifications in PostgreSQL for history and analytics
   - **Rationale**: Provides persistence, search capabilities, and leverages existing database

4. **Authentication Integration**: Reuse existing JWT authentication system for WebSocket connections
   - **Rationale**: Maintains security consistency and leverages existing user management

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Risk**: WebSocket connection scaling issues under high load
   - **Probability**: High
   - **Impact**: High
   - **Mitigation**: Implement connection pooling, load balancing, and horizontal scaling with Redis clustering

2. **Risk**: Memory usage with high concurrent connections
   - **Probability**: Medium
   - **Impact**: High
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize message payloads, implement connection limits, and add memory monitoring

3. **Risk**: Message delivery reliability in distributed environment
   - **Probability**: Medium
   - **Impact**: High
   - **Mitigation**: Implement message persistence, retry mechanisms, and delivery tracking

4. **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in WebSocket communications
   - **Probability**: Medium
   - **Impact**: High
   - **Mitigation**: Proper authentication, message validation, encrypted communications (WSS), and regular security audits

5. **Risk**: Integration complexity with existing authentication system
   - **Probability**: Low
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough integration testing and fallback authentication mechanisms

- **Message Optimization**: Minimize payload sizes and implement message batching
- **Caching Strategy**: Use Redis for active connection state and message queues
- **Load Distribution**: Implement round-robin or consistent hashing for connection distribution

### Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: Validate JWT tokens on WebSocket connection establishment
- **Authorization**: Check user permissions for system-wide notifications
- **Input Validation**: Validate all incoming messages and notification content
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for both individual and bulk notifications
