## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Pattern
- **Pattern**: Microservices with Security-First Design
- **Rationale**: Security isolation, independent scaling, specialized security services

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js + Security middleware
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with time-series extensions for audit logs
- **Cache**: Redis for security event processing and alert queuing
- **Security Libraries**: OWASP Dependency-Check, Helmet, Winston, Node-cron
- **External APIs**: Snyk API, Nessus Scanner API, OWASP feeds
- **Monitoring**: Custom security metrics + existing monitoring infrastructure

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Tamper-Proof Logging**: All audit logs are cryptographically signed and stored in append-only time-series database
2. **Real-time Processing**: Security events processed through Redis streams for sub-second detection
3. **Compliance-First Design**: All features designed with GDPR and security compliance as primary requirements
4. **Integration Strategy**: Security system enhances existing services without performance impact
5. **Alert Prioritization**: Machine learning-based alert correlation to reduce false positives

### Security Considerations
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control with audit trails
- **Network Security**: Security services isolated in separate network segments
- **Secrets Management**: Secure key management for all security operations
- **Compliance**: GDPR compliance with data minimization and right to deletion

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Risk**: Performance impact on main application
   - **Probability**: Medium
   - **Impact**: High
   - **Mitigation**: Asynchronous processing, dedicated security infrastructure, performance monitoring

2. **Risk**: False positive security alerts
   - **Probability**: High
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Machine learning correlation, configurable thresholds, manual review processes

3. **Risk**: Data privacy concerns with audit logs
   - **Probability**: Medium
   - **Impact**: High
   - **Mitigation**: Data encryption, minimal data collection, GDPR compliance, data retention policies

4. **Risk**: Integration complexity with existing systems
   - **Probability**: Medium
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Phased implementation, comprehensive testing, fallback mechanisms, API versioning

5. **Risk**: Security system vulnerabilities
   - **Probability**: Low
   - **Impact**: Critical
   - **Mitigation**: Security code reviews, penetration testing, dependency scanning, secure coding practices

## Resource Requirements
- **Team Size**: 3-4 security-focused developers
- **Timeline**: 8-10 weeks
- **Security Expertise**: Required (application security, compliance, threat detection)
- **External Tools**: Snyk license, Nessus scanner, security training budget
- **Infrastructure**: Dedicated security monitoring environment

## Dependencies
- **Internal Services**: User Authentication (002), Real-time Notifications (003)
- **External Services**: Snyk API, Nessus Scanner API, OWASP security feeds
- **Security Libraries**: OWASP Dependency-Check, Helmet, Winston, Node-cron
- **Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL with time-series extensions, Redis clusters
- **Compliance**: GDPR requirements, security standards documentation

## Monitoring & Success Metrics
- **Security Metrics**: Vulnerability count, mean time to detection (MTTD), mean time to response (MTTR)
- **Compliance Metrics**: GDPR compliance score, security policy adherence percentage
- **Performance Metrics**: Security scan duration, alert processing time, system resource usage
- **Business Metrics**: Security incident reduction, audit completion time, compliance audit success rate
- **Quality Metrics**: False positive rate, security test coverage, penetration test results
